# AUTOMATIC-FILE-ORGANIZATION
Here I have posted a code for file transfer on basis of extension.
This code will copy all the files from a folder which a user will input to folder where the user wants.
It will store the file in folder of there extension name.
It has many pre defined python libraries also.
